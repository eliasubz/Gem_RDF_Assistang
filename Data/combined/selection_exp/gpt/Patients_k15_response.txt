HealthcareEncounter: This class brings together the patient, department (Location), admission reason (could map to Procedure/Condition), admission/discharge dates, and identifiers. Each column (such as patient_id, admission_date, doctor, department, admission_reason) maps directly to properties or entities accessible via HealthcareEncounter. It is the strongest fit for the data row as a whole, semantically grouping the episode of care described by the row.\n// 2. AdministrativeCase: This class models a case within the encounter, including identifiers, admission/discharge datetimes, and patient link. If the row is really more about the case record than about the clinical episode per se, this is nearly as strong a fit as HealthcareEncounter.\n// 3. Patient: While many columns relate to individual attributes (identifier, gender, birthdate, name), the encounter/case/event aspects (department, admission/discharge, admission reason) do not derive directly from Patient. Thus, Patient is a weak but possible spanning anchor if row = single person.\n"}
