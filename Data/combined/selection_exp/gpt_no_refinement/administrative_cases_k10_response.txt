AdministrativeCase: This entity is designed to capture a single episode or case that involves a patient, their diagnosis, and the organization providing care. It naturally binds the patient (patient_id), diagnosis (diagnosis_code), the provider (org_code, org_name), and relevant meta-information (created_at) under one umbrella, representing the context for the entire row.\n2. OncologyDiagnosis: For datasets explicitly focused on clinical diagnostic information (especially cancer-related), OncologyDiagnosis tightly anchors patient, diagnosis code, and provider, but may be slightly narrower in scope than AdministrativeCase for generic cases.\n3. ProblemCondition: This entity records specific conditions diagnosed in a patient, linked to diagnosis code, patient, date, and organization, but is less operationally comprehensive than AdministrativeCase, as it focuses more on clinical phenomena than on the process and context of care."}
