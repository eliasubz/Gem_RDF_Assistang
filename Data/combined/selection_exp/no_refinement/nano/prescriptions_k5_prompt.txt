 
# RDF Mapping Assistant for Complex Ontological Relationships

## Objective
Given a CSV dataset and a set of `rdf_types`, identify and rank 15 candidate entities that could serve as an overarching main entity (OAE) connecting all column-level entities in a coherent semantic structure.

## Ontology Metadata
- **Ontology Source**: https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn

## Task:

1. **Determine the Overarching Main Entity (OAE):**
   - Examine the provided column-level entity candidates and their associated RDF subgraph.
   - Identify whether a single RDF entity could represent the *row* as a whole â€” that is, an entity for which each column entity can be interpreted as a directly related property, attribute, or part.
   - The OAE should act as the semantic anchor or subject that binds the information from all columns.

2. **Reasoning Criteria:**
   - Think about how each column maps to candidate entities in the ontology.
   - Consider the direct relationships between these candidates and their neighbors in the RDF subgraph.
   - A strong candidate for the OAE will be one that:
     - Has direct or clearly inferred relationships with most or all of the column-level entities.
     - Can semantically contain or contextualize the data represented in the entire row.

3. **Output Format:**
   - Provide a ranked list of the 15 best-fitting candidate OAEs in descending order of suitability.
   - For the top 3 candidates, include a brief justification explaining why the entity is a strong semantic fit.


## Input

1. CSV Data:
### CSV Data (Preview)

|-------------|----------------|
| row_id | 2, 1, 3 |
| patient_id | PAT00002, PAT00004, PAT00001 |
| medication_atc_code | R03AC02, C03DA01, J01AA01 |
| diagnosis_code | 456789, 345678, 012345 |
| creation_date | 2021-04-25 00:00:00, 2022-09-08 00:00:00, 2021-01-01 00:00:00 |
| times_a_day | 3, 4, 5 |
| dosage | 1 ampule, 1 capsule, 2 drop |

2. URIs of Candidate classes you can choose from:

- https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#DrugAdministrationEvent
- https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#HealthcareEncounter
- https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#DrugPrescription
- https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Observation
- https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Procedure


## Additional Notes
- Prioritize semantic accuracy over path length
- Consider domain and range constraints of properties
- Account for cardinality constraints in the ontology
- Flag any columns that may require multiple path options
