Let's analyze each CSV column systematically, selecting the most appropriate path based on the provided ontology and data semantics.

---

### Column: GEN_IDNUMBER
**Selected Path:** 1 https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Procedure -[https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/hasPatient]-> https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Patient  
**Justification:** The ID number uniquely identifies a patient and naturally maps to the Patient entity. Given the main entity is a Patient, associating the ID directly with the Patient is semantically correct.  
**Transformation:** No transformation needed; use the ID as a string literal linked to the Patient entity.

---

### Column: TABLE_IDENTIFIER
**Selected Path:** 2 https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Procedure -[https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/usingSubstance]-> https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Product  
**Justification:** The table identifier appears to be an internal label for a data record; mapping it to a Product (or a similar resource) associated with the procedure captures the concept of a data artifact. Alternatively, it could be mapped as an external identifier, but given the options, Product is more appropriate.  
**Transformation:** Map as a string literal or as an IRI if a unique identifier is available externally.

---

### Column: FIRST_NAME
**Selected Path:** 1 https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Procedure -[https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/hasPatient]-> https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Patient -[https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasGivenName]-> x  
**Justification:** The patient's first name is a property of the Patient entity. Since the main entity is Patient, the most precise path is directly from Patient to their given name.  
**Transformation:** Literal string.

---

### Column: LAST_NAME
**Selected Path:** Same as FIRST_NAME, with property `hasFamilyName` or equivalent (assumed to be available)  
**Justification:** Similar to first name, last name belongs to the Patient entity.  
**Transformation:** Literal string.

---

### Column: BIRTH_DATE
**Selected Path:** 1 https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Procedure -[https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/hasPatient]-> https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Patient -[https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasBirthDate]-> x  
**Justification:** The date of birth is an attribute of the Patient. Mapping directly from Patient to `hasBirthDate` is semantically appropriate.  
**Transformation:** Convert to xsd:date.

---

### Column: HOSPITAL_NAME
**Selected Path:** 4 https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Procedure -[https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasAdministrativeCase]-> https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#AdministrativeCase -[https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasHospitalName]-> x  
**Justification:** The hospital name is associated with an AdministrativeCase linked to the procedure, which reflects the context of care.  
**Transformation:** Literal string.

---

### Column: REFERRAL_HOSPITAL_NAME
**Selected Path:** Same as HOSPITAL_NAME, but via an AdministrativeCase or possibly directly linked to the Patient or Procedure if the ontology supports.  
**Justification:** Since the referral hospital is involved in the administrative process, mapping via AdministrativeCase is most semantically consistent.  
**Transformation:** Literal string.

---

### Column: DOCUMENT_DATE
**Selected Path:** 15 https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Procedure -[https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasDateTime]-> http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime  
**Justification:** The document date corresponds to the procedure's date, which is stored as a datetime property.  
**Transformation:** Convert to xsd:dateTime.

---

### Column: DOCUMENT_VERSION
**Selected Path:** 17 https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Procedure -[https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasFreeText]-> x  
**Justification:** Version info is textual and can be mapped as free text associated with the procedure or document. Alternatively, if versioning is formalized, a specific property could be used, but from the options, `hasFreeText` suffices.  
**Transformation:** String literal.

---

### Column: SIGN_PHYS
**Selected Path:** 10 https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Procedure -[https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasIntent]-> https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Intent  
**Justification:** The signatory is likely related to the procedure or report, and associating the signatory as an intent or responsible agent is reasonable. Alternatively, if there's a specific property for signatory, it could be used; but given available paths, `hasIntent` is acceptable.  
**Transformation:** Literal string.

---

### Column: DATE
**Selected Path:** 15 https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Procedure -[https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasDateTime]-> x (xsd:dateTime)  
**Justification:** The date of the record is mapped directly to the procedure's date property.  
**Transformation:** Convert to xsd:dateTime.

---

### Column: DIAGNOSE
**Selected Path:** 4 https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Procedure -[https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasFreeText]-> x  
**Justification:** The diagnosis is textual information, best mapped as free text associated with the procedure or clinical note.  
**Transformation:** String literal.

---

### Column: GEN_SEX
**Selected Path:** 1 or 13, mapped to Patient's gender property, e.g., `hasGender`  
**Justification:** Gender is an attribute of the Patient. Since the main entity is Patient, directly associating gender via a property like `hasGender` is appropriate.  
**Transformation:** String ('M', 'F', etc.).

---

### Column: BR_PR_BL_LATERALTIY
**Selected Path:** 5 https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Procedure -[https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasBodySite]-> https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#BodySite  
**Justification:** Laterality and location pertain to body sites, which are linked to the procedure.  
**Transformation:** String describing the site.

---

### Column: BR_LES_ID
**Selected Path:** 13 https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Procedure -[https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasSubjectPseudoIdentifier]-> https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#SubjectPseudoIdentifier  
**Justification:** The lesion ID is a pseudo-identifier for the lesion or tumor, linked to the procedure.

**Transformation:** String.

---

### Column: GEN_SMOKING
**Selected Path:** 1 or 13, mapped to Patient or related entity with `hasSmokingStatus` property (assuming).  
**Justification:** Smoking status is an attribute of the patient.  
**Transformation:** String ('Yes'/'No') or boolean if available.

---

### Column: GEN_BMI
**Selected Path:** 1 or 13, mapped to Patient via property `hasBMI` (or similar).  
**Justification:** BMI is an attribute of the patient.

## Summary
- Emphasis on mapping core patient attributes directly to the Patient entity where appropriate.
- Procedure-related data mapped through the procedure node, leveraging properties such as `hasDateTime`, `hasBodySite`, etc.
- Textual and date data stored as literals with proper datatype conversions.
- For attributes not explicitly covered by listed properties, use `hasFreeText` or custom properties if ontology permits.
