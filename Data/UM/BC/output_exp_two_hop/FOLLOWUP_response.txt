Column: GEN_IDNUMBER  
Path: 1 https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Procedure -[https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/hasPatient]-> https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Patient  
Justification: The GEN_IDNUMBER uniquely identifies a patient and directly links to the Patient entity via the hasPatient property, making this the most semantically precise path.

Column: TABLE_IDENTIFIER  
Path: 2 https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Procedure -[https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/usingSubstance]-> https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Product  
Justification: This column appears to be a unique session or report identifier associated with a Procedure, which is linked to a Product (e.g., a report or document). Alternatively, if it identifies a procedure or context, it could be mapped directly elsewhere, but given the data, linking via usingSubstance to Product captures the identifier's contextual role.

---

Column: SIGN_PHYS  
Path: 1 https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Procedure -[https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasSignPhysician]-> https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Physician (if exists), or via hasPerformedBy property.  
Justification: The sign physician is involved in the procedure; mapping through hasSignPhysician links to the Physician entity.  
Transformation: Map name to a Physician individual, or as a literal if no individual exists.

---

Column: REFERRAL_HOSPITAL_NAME  
Path: 4 as above, or possibly as part of the AdministrativeCase: AdministrativeCase -[https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#referralHospital]-> http://schema.org/Organization.  
Justification: The referring hospital is associated with the administrative process, possibly linked via referralHospital property.  
Transformation: Map string to hospital entity.

---

Column: DOCUMENT_DATE  
Path: 14 https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Procedure -[https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasCodingDateTime]-> xsd:dateTime  
Justification: A date associated with coding or documentation, linked to the Procedure, with datatype conversion.  
Transformation: Convert to xsd:dateTime literal.

---

Column: DOCUMENT_VERSION  
Path: 17 https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Procedure -[https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasFreeText]-> http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string

**Summary:**  
Each mapping was chosen based on the semantic role of the data, aligning with the main entity (Patient or Procedure) and utilizing the most precise, meaningful paths available in the ontology. Data types are converted to standard XML Schema datatypes where appropriate, ensuring compatibility and semantic clarity.
