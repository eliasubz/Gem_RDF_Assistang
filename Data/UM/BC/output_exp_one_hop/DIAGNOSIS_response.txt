**Column: GEN_IDNUMBER**  
**Path:** 1 https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Procedure -[https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/hasPatient]-> https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Patient  
**Justification:** The ID number likely pertains to the patient, which is linked via the 'hasPatient' property from the Procedure, and then to the Patient entity, making this path semantically appropriate.  
**Transformation:** None needed; assume the value is a string identifier.

**Column: TABLE_IDENTIFIER**  
**Path:** 2 https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Procedure -[https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/usingSubstance]-> https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Product  
**Justification:** The table identifier appears to be a unique code associated with the procedure or its component, which aligns with the 'usingSubstance' relation pointing to a Product. Alternatively, it could relate directly to the procedure or code but given the options, linking via 'usingSubstance' to a Product is most semantically relevant.  
**Transformation:** None needed; treat as a string.

**Column: DIAGNOSE_DATE**  
**Path:** 15 https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Procedure -[https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasDateTime]-> http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime  
**Justification:** The diagnosis date naturally maps to a date-time property linked to the procedure, capturing when the diagnosis was made.  
**Transformation:** Convert date string (e.g., "2023-10-01") into XML Schema dateTime format (e.g., "2023-10-01T00:00:00Z") if needed.

**Column: GEN_AGE_DIAGN**  
**Path:** 3 https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Procedure -[https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasSubjectPseudoIdentifier]-> https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#SubjectPseudoIdentifier  
**Justification:** The patient's age at diagnosis can be represented as a pseudo-identifier or attribute associated with the subject (patient), which is linked via 'hasSubjectPseudoIdentifier'. Alternatively, if age is a demographic detail, a more direct path could be considered; but given the provided paths, this is the most appropriate.  
**Transformation:** Numeric value; no transformation if stored as integer. If needed, cast as integer.
