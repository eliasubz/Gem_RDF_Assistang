Column: GEN_IDNUMBER  
Path: 1 https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Patient/hasIdentifier/genIDNumber  
Justification: The column likely represents a unique identifier for the patient, which aligns with the property "hasIdentifier" or similar in the ontology; since "hasIdentifier" is not explicitly listed, mapping to a custom identifier property under Patient is appropriate.  
Transformation: No transformation needed; treat as string.

---

Column: TABLE_IDENTIFIER  
Path: 1 https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Patient/hasIdentifier/tableID  
Justification: Similar to GEN_IDNUMBER, this probably is a secondary identifier or label for the patient, mapped as an identifier property; or, if not available, a custom property under Patient.  
Transformation: No transformation needed; treat as string.

Column: ANXILLARY_INFECTION  
Path: 4 https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Procedure -[https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasAdministrativeCase]-> https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#AdministrativeCase -[https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasComment]-> http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string  
*Alternative considered:* Using a custom property directly under Procedure, but the ontology suggests AdministrativeCase as a context for findings.  
Justification: The infection status can be recorded as an administrative note or case detail related to the procedure, making this path semantically appropriate.  
Transformation: Map "Nee"/"Ja"/"Onbekend" to boolean or string ("No"/"Yes"/"Unknown") as needed.

---

Column: HEMATOMA  
Path: 4 https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Procedure -[https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasAdministrativeCase]-> https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#AdministrativeCase -[https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasComment]-> http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string  
*Same reasoning as ANXILLARY_INFECTION:* recording complication status as an administrative comment.  
Transformation: Map "Ja"/"Nee" to boolean or string.

---

Column: SEROMA  
Path: 4 https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Procedure -[https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasAdministrativeCase]-> https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#AdministrativeCase -[https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasComment]-> http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string  
*Same as above.*

Column: DYSPHAGIA

Column: PAIN  
Path: 4 https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Procedure -[https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasAdministrativeCase]-> https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#AdministrativeCase -[https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasPainLevel]-> http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer  
*Alternative considered:* Using a property directly on Procedure, but pain is often a clinical note associated with administrative case or observation.  
Justification: Pain level is a clinical observation best mapped under AdministrativeCase or related observation context.  
Transformation: Map "2" to integer 2.

---

Column: EDEMA  
Path: 4 https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Procedure -[https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasAdministrativeCase]-> https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#AdministrativeCase -[https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasComment]-> http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string  
*Alternative considered:* Similar to other complications, stored as comment or observation.

---

Column: WHO_PS  
Path: 4 https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Procedure -[https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasComment]-> http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string or as a coded value in AdministrativeCase.  
*Justification:* Since WHO_PS appears to be a score or level, but given the options, storing as a comment or code is appropriate.

---

Column: MENOPAUSAL  
Path: 4 https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Procedure -[https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasSubjectPseudoIdentifier]-> https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#SubjectPseudoIdentifier  
*Alternative considered:* Possibly as a property indicating menopausal status directly linked to Patient, but the data is likely related to procedure context or observation.  
*Justification:* The status "Pre-menopausal" can be recorded as an attribute of the patient or as a note linked to the procedure, here mapped via SubjectPseudoIdentifier or similar.  
Transformation: Map "Pre-menopausal" as string.

---

Column: COPD  
Path: 4 https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Procedure -[https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasComment]-> http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string  
*Alternative considered:* Direct property on Patient, but given the pattern, administrative or clinical note is suitable.

---

Column: PAIN_MEDICATIE  
Path: 4 https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Procedure -[https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasMedication]-> https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Medication  
*Justification:* Medication related to pain management can be mapped as a Medication resource associated with the procedure or patient context.  
Transformation: Map "Ja" to presence of medication, or record medication name if available.

---

Column: PAIN_MEDICATIE_STATUS  
Path: 4 https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Procedure -[https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasMedicationStatus]-> http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string or coded terminology  
*Justification:* To record medication status code, using a property under Procedure.

---

**Summary:**
- For identifiers, use custom properties or existing identifier properties.
- For clinical findings (infection, hematoma, seroma, dyspagia, COPD), map to AdministrativeCase comments.
- For pain levels, use AdministrativeCase with numeric datatype.
- For categorical data (menopausal status, medication), map as string literals.
- For medication and status, map to appropriate resource and coded property.
