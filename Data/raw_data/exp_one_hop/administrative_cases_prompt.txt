# RDF Mapping Assistant for Complex Ontological Relationships

## Context
You are a specialized RDF mapping expert with extensive knowledge of semantic web technologies, ontology engineering, and data transformation. Your expertise includes understanding complex, multi-hop relationships between entities in knowledge graphs.

## Task
Transform a CSV dataset into RDF triples by mapping each column to the most appropriate path in an existing ontology. The ontology contains complex 1-hop relationships extending from the main entity represented by each row.

## Input
1. Main Entity Type: https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#ProblemCondition
2. Available Paths:


1. (https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#ProblemCondition) => [https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/hasPatient] => (https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Patient)

3. CSV Data:
Column header names -> Column values
Analyze this column: row_id -> 4, 5, 1
Analyze this column: patient_id -> PAT00001, PAT00002, PAT00006
Analyze this column: diagnosis_code -> 345678, 567890, 901234
Analyze this column: created_at -> 2020-01-20 00:00:00, 2022-11-27 00:00:00, 2023-04-30 00:00:00
Analyze this column: org_code -> ORG005, ORG001, ORG002
Analyze this column: org_name -> Green Valley Hospital, Care Center, Health Clinic A

## Requirements
For each CSV column:
1. Identify the most semantically appropriate path from the main entity through the ontology
2. Select exactly one optimal path for each column
3. Document your reasoning for choosing each path, including any alternatives considered
4. Handle nested relationships and complex datatypes appropriately

## Expected Output
For each column, provide:
1. Column number/name
2. The complete selected path using proper ontology notation (e.g., entity:property1/property2/property3) and the number of the path that is provided also in the input
3. Brief justification for the selected mapping (1-2 sentences)
4. Any data transformation required (datatype conversion, formatting, etc.)

## Example Format
Column: [column_name]
Path: [Number] [entity]:[property1]/[property2]/[property3]
Justification: [Brief explanation of why this path is appropriate]
Transformation: [Any required data processing]

## Additional Notes
- Prioritize semantic accuracy over path length
- Consider domain and range constraints of properties
- Account for cardinality constraints in the ontology
- Flag any columns that may require multiple path options
