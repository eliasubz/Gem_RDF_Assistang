Path 10 ('hasDrugQuantity') to Quantity is correct. While path 72 ('hasDrugQuantity' → 'hasValue' [double]) or 73 ('hasValue' [string]) could be used, the cell value includes both numeric and unit, so mapping to the full Quantity object is optimal; Quantity's hasValue and hasUnit should be extracted from the string."
