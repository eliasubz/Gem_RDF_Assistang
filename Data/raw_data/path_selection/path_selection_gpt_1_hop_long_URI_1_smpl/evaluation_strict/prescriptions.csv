This field is best used as an internal mapping key and not mapped directly to RDF. If needed, it can be used to generate unique URIs for the RDF instances."

No 2-hop paths are available from Patient, so this is the most direct and semantically correct mapping."

Path #5 links DrugPrescription to a Code, which is the appropriate representation. There is also path #6 (hasCode->Terminology), but Code is the entity suitable for the code value itself, while Terminology would be for the code system, not the value."

Path #12 links DrugPrescription to Diagnosis via hasIndicationToStart, which is the most accurate semantic mapping. Path #13 (hasIndicationToStart->Intent) is not appropriate because diagnosis_code is a diagnosis, not an intent."

No 2-hop path from Quantity exists that would improve this mapping."
