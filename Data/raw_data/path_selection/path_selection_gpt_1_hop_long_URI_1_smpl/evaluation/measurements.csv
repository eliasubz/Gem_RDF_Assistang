row_id,gpt_nano,[-1],-1,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasQualitativeResult,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasQualitativeResult,http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string,http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string,,,,,,,,,1,1,The 'row_id' is an internal CSV row identifier and does not correspond directly to any biomedical semantic path. It can be used as a local identifier for the Measurement subject node (IRI or blank node) but does not map to a semantic property. No 2-hop path is available for such an identifier.
patient_id,gpt_nano,[0],0,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/hasPatient,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/hasPatient,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Patient,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Patient,,,,,,,,,1,1,"The 'patient_id' corresponds to the patient who is the subject of the measurement. Path 1 (hasPatient) directly links Measurement to Patient, which is the most semantically appropriate. No 2-hop path from Patient is available, so this 1-hop path is optimal."
measurement_code,gpt_nano,[3],3,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasCode,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasCode,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Code,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Code,,,,,,,,,1,1,"The 'measurement_code' (e.g., E11.9) is a code representing the type of measurement. Path 4 (hasCode to Code) is most precise. Path 5 (hasCode to Terminology) is less specific, as Terminology usually refers to the coding system, not the code value. No 2-hop paths from Code exist."
measurement_value,gpt_nano,[13],13,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasQuantity,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasQuantity,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Quantity,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Quantity,,,,,,,,,1,1,"This is the measured numeric value. Path 14 (hasQuantity) links Measurement to Quantity, which is the canonical structure for quantitative results in clinical ontologies. No 2-hop path from Quantity is available, so this is the best match."
measurement_unit,gpt_nano,[13],13,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasQuantity,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasQuantity,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Quantity,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Quantity,,,,,,,,,1,1,"Measurement units (e.g., mg/dL) are typically properties of Quantity. While there is no direct path from Measurement to a Unit, the standard RDF pattern is: Measurement --hasQuantity--> Quantity (with value and unit). No 2-hop path is available; thus, map as part of the Quantity entity."
measurement_date,gpt_nano,[19],19,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasMeasurementDateTime,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasMeasurementDateTime,http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime,http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime,,,,,,,,,1,1,"This column records when the measurement occurred. Path 20 (hasMeasurementDateTime) is a direct, precise match. Path 18 (hasDateTime) is more generic; Path 20 is preferred as it is specific to the measurement event. No 2-hop path from dateTime is meaningful."
