Since no direct path for row_id exists, the closest semantically appropriate path is 'hasAdministrativeCase/hasIdentifier' (path 46) or 'hasDataFile/hasIdentifier' (path 57). However, these are not ideal because row_id is a CSV internal ID, not an administrative case or data file identifier. Therefore, 'row_id' is best treated as an internal identifier and mapped to no ontology path or to a custom property outside the given ontology. Since no direct mapping exists, it is flagged as unmapped or requiring custom handling."

Path 25 leads from DrugPrescription to Patient then to PatientIdentifier, which is the semantically correct place to map patient identifiers. It's more precise than mapping to SubjectPseudoIdentifier (path 16) because PatientIdentifier is explicitly for patient IDs."

Mapping it to DrugPrescription → hasDrug → hasCode → hasIdentifier (path 48) is semantically appropriate because it links to the drug code identifier, capturing the medication ATC code precisely. A 2-hop path through Drug then Code then Identifier is better than only to Drug or Code alone."

Path 76 via hasFrequency (a Quantity) then hasValue (double) is the most semantically appropriate to capture frequency count.

Path 73 maps DrugPrescription → hasDrugQuantity (Quantity) → hasValue (string) to capture dosage including value and unit as a string (e.g., '1 capsule').
