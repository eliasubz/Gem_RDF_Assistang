It does not map to a deeper property but identifies the main entity instance."
patient_id,gpt_nano,"[15, 0]",0,0,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasSubjectPseudoIdentifier,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/hasPatient,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#SubjectPseudoIdentifier,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Patient,,,,,,,,,1,1,The patient_id corresponds to the patient associated with the drug prescription. The path to Patient entity via 'hasPatient' is the most semantically appropriate to represent this linkage.
medication_atc_code,gpt_nano,[4],8,0,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasCode,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasDrug,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Code,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Drug,,,,,,,,,1,1,"The medication ATC code is best represented as a code of the Drug entity linked to the DrugPrescription. Since the code is a property of the drug, the two-hop path through 'hasDrug' then 'hasCode' is more semantically accurate than directly attaching the code to the prescription."
diagnosis_code,gpt_nano,[11],11,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasIndicationToStart,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasIndicationToStart,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Diagnosis,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Diagnosis,,,,,,,,,1,1,"Diagnosis code corresponds to the indication to start the drug prescription; the 'hasIndicationToStart' property linking to Diagnosis is the best semantic fit. Although 'hasIndicationToStart' can link to Intent, diagnosis is more appropriate for a diagnosis code."
creation_date,gpt_nano,[17],17,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasDateTime,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasDateTime,http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime,http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime,,,,,,,,,1,1,'creation_date' fits naturally to the 'hasDateTime' property of the DrugPrescription to record when the prescription was created.

This is more specific than the general 'hasQuantity' property."
