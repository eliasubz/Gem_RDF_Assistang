row_id,gpt_nano,[-1],-1,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasQualitativeResult,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasQualitativeResult,http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string,http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string,,,,,,,,,1,1,"The CSV 'row_id' is an internal sequential identifier for the CSV rows without a direct semantic property in the ontology. None of the provided paths correspond to identifiers for the Measurement itself, so this is considered metadata outside the ontology paths."

Path 1 directly links Measurement to Patient via 'hasPatient', making it the most semantically relevant path. No deeper 2-hop paths from Patient improve semantic specificity for an identifier."

There are two options (paths 4 and 5) both via 'hasCode' to Code or Terminology. Code (path 4) is chosen as it directly corresponds to the code value, while Terminology (path 5) would represent the coding system. No suitable deeper 2-hop path improves this mapping for a single code value."

No deeper 2-hop paths from Quantity are listed, so this direct path is optimal."
measurement_unit,gpt_nano,[13],13,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasQuantity,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasQuantity,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Quantity,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Quantity,,,,,,,,,1,1,"'measurement_unit' is a property of the Quantity entity linked via 'hasQuantity' (path 14). Since unit is an attribute of Quantity, it is semantically correct to map unit information within the Quantity node. No deeper 2-hop paths for unit in the provided paths."

This is more specific than a general 'hasDateTime' (path 18). No longer 2-hop paths improve temporal specificity."
