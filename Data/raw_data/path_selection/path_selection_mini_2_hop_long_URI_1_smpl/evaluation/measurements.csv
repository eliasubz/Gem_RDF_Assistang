Path 32 connects Measurement directly to an identifier string, which semantically fits as a unique ID for the measurement. No 2-hop path provides a more specific or relevant identifier for the measurement entity."

Path 26 traverses from Measurement to Patient and then to PatientIdentifier, which is semantically more precise than just linking to Patient entity (path 1). Thus, the 2-hop path is preferred for exact patient ID mapping."
measurement_code,gpt_nano,[3],3,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasCode,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasCode,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Code,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Code,,,,,,,,,1,1,"'measurement_code' represents a code identifying the measurement type. Path 4 directly links Measurement to Code, semantically suitable for the measurement code. Although there are 2-hop paths through Code to Terminology (path 5), the CSV column only contains the code itself, not terminology info, so the 1-hop path is optimal."

Path 87 navigates Measurement -> Quantity -> hasValue (string). Although path 86 (hasValue as double) is an alternative, given example '56.48' is numeric; however, some values might be string (e.g., 'ND' for Not Detected). Choosing string allows broader coverage and avoids type conflicts. If numeric only, path 86 could be better."

Path 85 (Measurement -> Quantity -> hasUnit) is semantically exact for associating units with the measurement value. No 2-hop path offers a better alternative for unit representation.

Path 20 directly links Measurement to an xsd:dateTime literal for measurement date/time, which is semantically appropriate. Alternative date/time properties exist (e.g., hasDateTime path 18), but hasMeasurementDateTime is more specific for the measurement event."
