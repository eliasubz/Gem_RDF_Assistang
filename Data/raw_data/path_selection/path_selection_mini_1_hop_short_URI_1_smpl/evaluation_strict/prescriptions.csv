row_id,gpt_nano,[-1],15,0,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasLastAdministrationDateTime,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasSubjectPseudoIdentifier,http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#SubjectPseudoIdentifier,,,,,,,,,1,1,'row_id' is a unique identifier for each drug prescription record. The closest ontology path representing a unique identifier associated with the main entity is 'hasSubjectPseudoIdentifier'. No 2-hop paths from this node provide a better semantic match.
patient_id,gpt_nano,"[15, 0]",0,0,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasSubjectPseudoIdentifier,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/hasPatient,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#SubjectPseudoIdentifier,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Patient,,,,,,,,,1,1,"'patient_id' semantically corresponds to the patient entity related to the drug prescription. The path via 'AIDAVA:hasPatient' directly links the prescription to the patient entity. No deeper (2-hop) path from Patient is provided, so this 1-hop path is optimal."
medication_atc_code,gpt_nano,[4],4,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasCode,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasCode,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Code,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Code,,,,,,,,,1,1,"The 'medication_atc_code' represents a drug code, which aligns with the drug's code property. Instead of mapping to 'hasDrug' alone, extending to 'hasCode' of the drug provides precise semantic mapping. The 2-hop path through 'hasDrug' then 'hasCode' is better than just 'hasDrug'."
diagnosis_code,gpt_nano,[11],11,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasIndicationToStart,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasIndicationToStart,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Diagnosis,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Diagnosis,,,,,,,,,1,1,"The diagnosis code represents the indication to start the drug, which relates to a diagnosis entity. Although only 'hasIndicationToStart' is listed, it can point to either Diagnosis or Intent. The best semantic match is linking to Diagnosis's code via 'hasIndicationToStart'. Since direct 'hasCode' under 'hasIndicationToStart' is not explicitly listed, mapping to 'hasIndicationToStart' (Diagnosis) is chosen as the best available path (path 12)."
creation_date,gpt_nano,[17],17,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasDateTime,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasDateTime,http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime,http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime,,,,,,,,,1,1,Creation date is a datetime related to the drug prescription event. The direct property 'hasDateTime' with datatype xsd:dateTime is the optimal semantic match. No longer path is more precise.
times_a_day,gpt_nano,[10],10,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasFrequency,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasFrequency,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Quantity,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Quantity,,,,,,,,,1,1,"'times_a_day' indicates frequency of administration, semantically matching 'hasFrequency' which links to a Quantity entity representing frequency. No deeper 2-hop path is available to improve semantic accuracy."
dosage,gpt_nano,[9],14,0,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasDrugQuantity,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasQuantity,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Quantity,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Quantity,,,,,,,,,1,1,'dosage' corresponds to the quantity of drug prescribed. The property 'hasQuantity' linking to Quantity is the correct semantic match. No 2-hop paths offer better specificity.
