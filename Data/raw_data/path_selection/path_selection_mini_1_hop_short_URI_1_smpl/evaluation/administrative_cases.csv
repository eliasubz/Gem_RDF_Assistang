row_id,gpt_nano,[0],12,0,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/hasPatient,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasSubjectPseudoIdentifier,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Patient,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#SubjectPseudoIdentifier,,,,,,,,,1,1,"The 'row_id' is a unique identifier for the record, best mapped to the 'hasSubjectPseudoIdentifier' property of ProblemCondition, which captures unique pseudo-identifiers. No longer paths from this property add semantic value for this field."
patient_id,gpt_nano,"[12, 0]",0,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasSubjectPseudoIdentifier,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/hasPatient,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#SubjectPseudoIdentifier,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Patient,,,,,,,,,1,1,The 'patient_id' corresponds directly to the patient entity related to the ProblemCondition via 'hasPatient'; this path semantically fits patient identification best. No deeper paths from Patient provided that improve mapping for patient ID.
diagnosis_code,gpt_nano,[4],4,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasCode,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasCode,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Code,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Code,,,,,,,,,1,1,The 'diagnosis_code' corresponds to a medical code describing the condition; 'hasCode' pointing to 'Code' entity is the most precise semantic match. Alternatives like 'Terminology' exist but 'Code' is more specific and appropriate here.
created_at,gpt_nano,[13],16,0,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasDateTime,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasRecordDateTime,http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime,http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime,,,,,,,,,1,1,"The 'created_at' timestamp aligns with the 'hasRecordDateTime' property indicating when the record/condition was recorded, which semantically fits best. Other datetime properties like 'hasDateTime' or 'hasOnsetDateTime' do not accurately describe record creation time."
org_code,gpt_nano,[7],7,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasDataProviderInstitute,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasDataProviderInstitute,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#DataProviderInstitute,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#DataProviderInstitute,,,,,,,,,1,1,"The 'org_code' identifies the organization providing data; 'hasDataProviderInstitute' points to the institute entity related to the ProblemCondition, which is semantically appropriate. No deeper path from DataProviderInstitute is provided to refine further."
org_name,gpt_nano,[7],7,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasDataProviderInstitute,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasDataProviderInstitute,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#DataProviderInstitute,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#DataProviderInstitute,,,,,,,,,1,1,"The 'org_name' is an attribute of the data provider institute; mapping it under 'hasDataProviderInstitute' is semantically correct to tie the name to the institute entity. Since no further path for institute name is given, it is assumed as a literal attribute at this node."
