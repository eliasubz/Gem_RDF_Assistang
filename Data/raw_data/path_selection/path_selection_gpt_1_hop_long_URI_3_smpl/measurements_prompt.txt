# RDF Mapping Assistant for Complex Ontological Relationships

## Objective
Given a CSV dataset and a set of ontology paths rooted in a main entity class, map each column to the most semantically appropriate ontology path, producing RDF triples for later use.

### CSV Data (Preview)

| Column Name | Example Values |
|-------------|----------------|
| row_id | 2, 4, 3 |
| patient_id | PAT00003, PAT00004, PAT00002 |
| measurement_code | R00.0, Z99.89, R50.9 |
| measurement_value | 101.93, 56.48, 81.12 |
| measurement_unit | mg/dL, /minn, mm[Hg] |
| measurement_date | 2025-01-27, 2025-02-19, 2025-02-03 |

## Requirements
For each CSV column:
1. Identify the most semantically appropriate path from the main entity through the ontology
2. Select exactly one optimal path for each column
3. Document your reasoning for choosing each path, including any alternatives considered
4. Handle nested relationships and complex datatypes appropriately

## Expected Output
For each column, provide:
1. Column number/name
2. The complete selected path using proper ontology notation (e.g., entity:property1/property2/property3) and the number of the path that is provided also in the input
3. Brief justification for the selected mapping (1-2 sentences)
4. Any data transformation required (datatype conversion, formatting, etc.)



## Example Format
"column_mappings": [
    {
        "column_name": "entity_id",
        "path": {
            "path_id": 1
        },
        "justification": "The 'entity_id' field represents a unique identifier associated with the main observation, making this path semantically appropriate.",
        "transformation": "Ensure the ID format matches URI requirements (e.g., prefix or encode)."
    },
]

### Specific Instructions
Before selecting a 1-hop path, first check if any 2-hop paths that begin from the same end node as that 1-hop path offer a better option. If not, explain why they aren't better before proceeding with the 1-hop path.

## Additional Notes
- Prioritize semantic accuracy over path length
- Consider domain and range constraints of properties
- Account for cardinality constraints in the ontology
- Flag any columns that may require multiple path options
