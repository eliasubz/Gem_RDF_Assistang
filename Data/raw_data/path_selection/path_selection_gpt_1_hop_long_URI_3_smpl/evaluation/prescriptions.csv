row_id,gpt_nano,[-1],-1,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasLastAdministrationDateTime,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasLastAdministrationDateTime,http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime,http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime,,,,,,,,,1,1,"The 'row_id' appears to be an internal identifier for each record. The ontology does not provide a specific path for a row or record ID, but it is common to use an internal or system-generated identifier directly on the main entity. No provided path fits exactly, so this would be modeled as the resource's unique URI or a local identifier."
patient_id,gpt_nano,[0],0,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/hasPatient,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/hasPatient,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Patient,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Patient,,,,,,,,,1,1,"The 'patient_id' directly corresponds to the patient involved in the drug prescription. Path 1 (hasPatient) links DrugPrescription to Patient, which is the most accurate representation. Alternative path 16 (hasSubjectPseudoIdentifier) links to SubjectPseudoIdentifier, but this is typically used for pseudonymized IDs, not direct patient links. Therefore, path 1 is preferred."
medication_atc_code,gpt_nano,[4],4,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasCode,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasCode,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Code,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Code,,,,,,,,,1,1,"The 'medication_atc_code' is a standardized code (ATC) for medications. Path 5 (hasCode) connects DrugPrescription to Code, which is meant for such standardized representations. There is also path 6 (hasCode to Terminology), but unless the code system itself needs to be referenced, path 5 is more direct and suitable for the actual code value."
diagnosis_code,gpt_nano,[11],11,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasIndicationToStart,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasIndicationToStart,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Diagnosis,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Diagnosis,,,,,,,,,1,1,"The 'diagnosis_code' provides the reason (indication) for the prescription. Path 12 (hasIndicationToStart to Diagnosis) is preferable, as it models the clinical reason for the prescription in accordance with standard medical semantics. Path 13 (hasIndicationToStart to Intent) is less precise for diagnosis codes."
creation_date,gpt_nano,[17],17,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasDateTime,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasDateTime,http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime,http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime,,,,,,,,,1,1,"The 'creation_date' records when the DrugPrescription was created. Path 18 (hasDateTime) directly links to an xsd:dateTime, which matches the data type and semantics. No multi-hop path is available that offers a better fit."
times_a_day,gpt_nano,[10],10,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasFrequency,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasFrequency,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Quantity,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Quantity,,,,,,,,,1,1,The 'times_a_day' value indicates dosing frequency. Path 11 (hasFrequency to Quantity) is semantically appropriate as it models frequency as a quantitative value. There is no more specific 2-hop path available here.
dosage,gpt_nano,[9],14,0,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasDrugQuantity,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasQuantity,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Quantity,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Quantity,,,,,,,,,1,1,"The 'dosage' specifies the amount of medication per administration. Path 15 (hasQuantity to Quantity) is the best fit, as it models the dosage as a quantitative value. Alternative options (hasDrugQuantity or hasFrequency) are less appropriate: hasDrugQuantity (path 10) might also be used, but it may refer to the quantity being prescribed or dispensed, not necessarily the per-administration dose. If both are needed, further disambiguation is required; for now, hasQuantity is chosen for its generality."
