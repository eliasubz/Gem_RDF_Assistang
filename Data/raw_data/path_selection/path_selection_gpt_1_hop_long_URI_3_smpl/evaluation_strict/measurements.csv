row_id,gpt_nano,[-1],-1,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasQualitativeResult,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasQualitativeResult,http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string,http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string,,,,,,,,,1,1,"The 'row_id' serves as a technical identifier for each row in the CSV and is not modeled in the ontology paths provided. Typically, this can be mapped to a local identifier or used to generate the URI for each Measurement instance."
patient_id,gpt_nano,[0],0,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/hasPatient,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/hasPatient,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Patient,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Patient,,,,,,,,,1,1,"The patient_id matches the concept of a Patient entity linked from a Measurement. No 2-hop path from Patient is provided, so this is the optimal mapping."
measurement_code,gpt_nano,[3],3,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasCode,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasCode,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Code,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Code,,,,,,,,,1,1,"measurement_code represents a code describing the measurement, which aligns directly with 'hasCode' to Code. No 2-hop paths from Code are provided here. The alternative (path 5) is to Terminology, but this field contains actual codes, not terminology metadata."
measurement_value,gpt_nano,[13],13,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasQuantity,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasQuantity,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Quantity,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Quantity,,,,,,,,,1,1,"measurement_value is a numeric value and best fits as a Quantity. While Quantity may itself have a value and unit, no 2-hop path from Quantity is available in the provided options, thus direct mapping to hasQuantity is optimal."
measurement_unit,gpt_nano,[13],13,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasQuantity,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasQuantity,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Quantity,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Quantity,,,,,,,,,1,1,"measurement_unit is semantically part of the Quantity concept. While ideally this would be a property of Quantity (e.g., Quantity.unit), no 2-hop path to a unit is available, so it should be included as part of the same Quantity node as measurement_value."
measurement_date,gpt_nano,[19],19,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasMeasurementDateTime,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasMeasurementDateTime,http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime,http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime,,,,,,,,,1,1,"measurement_date is the date/time when the measurement was taken. hasMeasurementDateTime (path 20) is more precise than hasDateTime (path 18), as it specifically refers to the measurement event. No 2-hop path is available from dateTime."
