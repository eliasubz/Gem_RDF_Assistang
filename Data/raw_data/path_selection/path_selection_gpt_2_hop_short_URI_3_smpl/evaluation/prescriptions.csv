Of available patient paths, path 25 (DrugPrescription → hasPatient → hasPatientIdentifier) is most semantically accurate, as it directly connects a prescription's patient to their unique identifier entity. Other paths (such as 1 or 31) either stop at the patient or use a more generic identifier property not specific to patient entities."

Among code-related paths (e.g., 9, 64, 68), path 68 (DrugPrescription → hasDrug → hasProductCode) is best as it specifically references the product code of the drug entity, which is typically where an ATC code would reside. The 2-hop path is preferred over the 1-hop 'hasCode' (path 5) as it targets the drug's product code rather than a generic code."

The optimal path is DrugPrescription → hasIndicationToStart → Diagnosis → hasCode → Code → hasIdentifier, which (by path 81) semantically matches the notion of a diagnosis identified by a code. A 2-hop path is chosen over the 1-hop 'hasIndicationToStart' (12) to ensure the code is linked specifically to the diagnosis entity."

While the Quantity class supports structured value/unit separation, this column is unstructured, so the path DrugPrescription → hasDrugQuantity → Quantity → hasValue (string), path 73, is appropriate. The alternative would be to split value/unit and map value to path 72 (double), but this is not possible with the current data format."
