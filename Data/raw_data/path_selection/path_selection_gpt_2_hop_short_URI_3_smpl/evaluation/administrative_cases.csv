row_id,gpt_nano,[0],-2,0,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/hasPatient,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasSubjectPseudoIdentifier,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Patient,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#SubjectPseudoIdentifier,,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasDataProviderInstitute,,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#DataProviderInstitute,,,,,1,2,"There is no direct path for an internal row identifier. Since 'row_id' is likely a technical/auxiliary field for data provenance or indexing, it does not correspond to a modeled SPHN ontology property. If it needs to be mapped for provenance, it could be added as a custom annotation or ignored in strict RDF transformation."
patient_id,gpt_nano,[0],22,0,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/hasPatient,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/hasPatient,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Patient,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Patient,,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/hasPatientIdentifier,,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/PatientIdentifier,,,,,1,2,"The 'patient_id' is best mapped via the 2-hop path: ProblemCondition → hasPatient → hasPatientIdentifier. This is preferred over the 1-hop path to Patient (path 1) because it directly targets the identifier, which matches the CSV content. Alternative 2-hop paths like (28) to sphn:hasIdentifier expect a string, but (23) is more semantically accurate for a patient identifier entity."
diagnosis_code,gpt_nano,[4],66,0,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasCode,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasCode,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Code,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Code,,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasIdentifier,,http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string,,,,,1,2,"The 'diagnosis_code' is optimally mapped as ProblemCondition → hasCode → hasIdentifier, since this captures the code value itself (the numeric/string code). This is preferable to the 1-hop hasCode path (5), which just reaches a Code entity, or 2-hop paths to terminology, which are not specific to code values."
created_at,gpt_nano,[13],16,0,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasDateTime,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasRecordDateTime,http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime,http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime,,,,,,,,,1,1,The 'created_at' field represents the creation/recording timestamp of the ProblemCondition. 'hasRecordDateTime' directly captures this semantics. No 2-hop path offers a more precise or relevant option for this column.

The 1-hop path (8) only reaches the DataProviderInstitute entity, not the code. The 2-hop path (79) specifically targets the code identifier, matching the CSV value."
org_name,gpt_nano,"[80, 7]",80,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasDataProviderInstitute,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasDataProviderInstitute,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#DataProviderInstitute,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#DataProviderInstitute,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasName,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasName,http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string,http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string,,,,,2,2,The 'org_name' corresponds to the name of the DataProviderInstitute. Mapping through ProblemCondition → hasDataProviderInstitute → hasName (path 81) directly assigns the string label to the institute. No deeper or alternative path more specifically targets the institute's name.
