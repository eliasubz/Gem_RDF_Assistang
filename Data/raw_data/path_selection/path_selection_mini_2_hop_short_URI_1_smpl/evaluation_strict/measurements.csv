However, since no direct Measurement identifier path is listed, and 'row_id' serves as a unique measurement record ID, using AdministrativeCase's identifier path is the best proxy. Alternatively, if Measurement had a direct identifier property it would be preferred, but none is listed."

Path 26 directly links Measurement to Patient then to PatientIdentifier, which semantically matches the patient ID column best, as opposed to indirect or string-only identifiers elsewhere."

Path 50 extends from Measurement to Code entity and then to its identifier property, which is semantically appropriate for coded measurement concepts. The 2-hop path is better than just linking to Code (path 4) because it specifies the identifier attribute, which matches the code value."

Path 86 goes from Measurement to Quantity to the numeric value property, which directly captures the numeric measurement data. This 2-hop path is preferred over just attaching a literal value directly to Measurement as it preserves semantic precision and units."
