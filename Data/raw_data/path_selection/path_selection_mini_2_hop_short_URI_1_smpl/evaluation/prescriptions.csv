Although the ontology does not explicitly list a direct identifier property for DrugPrescription, path 46 provides an identifier at the AdministrativeCase level which is related but not directly suitable. No direct 1-hop identifier property for DrugPrescription is found, so as no alternative is better, we use the administrative case identifier as a proxy. Alternatively, a custom property could be used if available. This is a limitation due to the ontology. "
