Since no path directly represents such an internal ID, this can be mapped to a local identifier for the RDF resource (e.g., used in URI construction), but it does not directly correspond to any explicit path in the ontology."
patient_id,gpt_nano,[0],12,0,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/hasPatient,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasSubjectPseudoIdentifier,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Patient,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#SubjectPseudoIdentifier,,,,,,,,,1,1,"The 'patient_id' represents a pseudonymous patient identifier, which is exactly modelled by 'hasSubjectPseudoIdentifier'. Two-hop alternatives (e.g., via Patient or PatientIdentifier) exist (paths 1+23, etc.), but they either require further indirection or are not as direct as this 1-hop path, which is specifically intended for a pseudonymized patient ID."

There are 2-hop options (e.g., path 66â€“68), allowing further details about the code such as system and name, but the CSV only provides the code itself, not additional subproperties. Thus, the direct 1-hop path is optimal."

Other datetime options (e.g., onset, general datetime) exist (paths 14, 16), but 'hasRecordDateTime' is the semantically closest for record creation."

The path 'hasDataProviderInstitute' is the only direct path to a DataProviderInstitute. There are 2-hop paths for code within DataProviderInstitute (path 79), but since only the code is given, and not the DataProviderInstitute entity as a whole, the 2-hop path could be used if the code needs to be attached to the Institute, but requires instantiating the DataProviderInstitute. For a simple mapping, the direct path is chosen; for richer RDF, combine with path 79."

The direct path is 'hasDataProviderInstitute'; the institute's name property is a 2-hop path (path 81), which could be used if the DataProviderInstitute node is instantiated. The 1-hop path is chosen for the main link, but to include the name, path 81 should be used for the name property of the DataProviderInstitute node."
