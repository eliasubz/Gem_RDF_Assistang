Two-hop options from Patient (e.g., administrative gender, birthdate, etc.) (paths 21-31) don't match the column's actual content, which is an identifier for the patient entity, not an attribute of the patient. Therefore, the direct link to Patient (path 1) is optimal."

Downstream options from Drug (paths 63-70) include active/inactive ingredients, dose form, and codes. Of these, path 64 (hasDrug/hasCode) is more specific for codes, but given the ATC is a coding system for drugs, path 64 is the most semantically precise. However, the direct link (path 9) is used as the first hop, and the actual value should be mapped via the two-hop path in a full RDF model. For this mapping, use the path to Drug entity (path 9); downstream mapping to Code would be handled in nested triple generation."

Downstream hops from Diagnosis (e.g., path 81: hasIndicationToStart/hasCode) allow for precise code mapping, but since the column is a code for the diagnosis, path 81 is optimal as it lands directly on the code. Thus, select path 81: DrugPrescription/hasIndicationToStart/Diagnosis/hasCode/Code."

No 2-hop date/time-related paths from DrugPrescription are more specific than the direct hasDateTime (path 18), as other time-related paths (e.g., paths 19, 20) relate to administration events, not creation of the prescription."

Downstream from DrugQuantity (paths 70-73), hasValue (72) and hasUnit (71) could be used for more granular mapping. Ideally, parse the dosage value for quantity and unit and map accordingly: DrugPrescription/hasDrugQuantity/Quantity/hasValue (72) for numeric and hasUnit (71) for the unit."
