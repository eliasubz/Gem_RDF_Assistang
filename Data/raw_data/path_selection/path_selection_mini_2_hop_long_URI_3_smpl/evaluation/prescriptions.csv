Path 31 directly links DrugPrescription to an identifier string, making it the most semantically accurate and straightforward mapping. No two-hop path improves this as no further nested identifier context is given for the main entity."

Path 25 traverses from DrugPrescription to Patient and then to PatientIdentifier, directly matching the semantic meaning of patient_id. Two-hop paths beyond this (e.g., to patient's name or birthdate) are less appropriate for an identifier field."

Path 64 leads from DrugPrescription to Drug and then to Code, which semantically fits medication codes. Although there are further nested paths to Terminology or CodingSystem, the direct code property is optimal for the code value itself. More complex paths for terminology are unnecessary here unless additional coding system info is required."

Path 81 goes from DrugPrescription to Diagnosis (IndicationToStart) and then to Code, exactly matching the diagnosis code semantic. Alternatives involving Terminology or nested patient relations are less direct and thus less appropriate for a code column."

Alternative paths to DrugQuantity exist but Quantity is more general and suitable unless the dataset distinguishes drug quantity specifically; here dosage is best under Quantity."
