If an identifier is needed in RDF, generate a local URI or blank node using this value."

No 2-hop path exists from AIDAVA:Patient, so this 1-hop path is optimal."

A 2-hop alternative exists via Terminology (path 5), but unless the dataset includes terminology metadata, direct mapping to Code is more precise."

No 2-hop path from Quantity is available, so direct mapping is semantically optimal."

Since the ontology links to Quantity, and units are typically modeled as a property of Quantity, this is the most appropriate path; no 2-hop path offers a superior mapping."

There is no more specific 2-hop path from dateTime, so this is optimal."
