As such, 'row_id' is best used as the local identifier for the RDF resource representing the ProblemCondition itself, not as a property. This would typically be used to construct the subject URI for each ProblemCondition instance."

Path 1 (hasPatient) directly links ProblemCondition to Patient, which is the intended relationship. No further 2-hop path is available for Patient from the provided list."
diagnosis_code,gpt_nano,[4],4,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasCode,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasCode,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Code,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Code,,,,,,,,,1,1,"The 'diagnosis_code' is a code that describes the problem condition. Path 5 (hasCode to Code) is the most direct and semantically precise mapping. There is also a path to Terminology (path 6), but unless the code is being mapped to a specific terminology system or includes system metadata, the Code class is the better fit."

Path 17 (hasRecordDateTime) directly refers to when the ProblemCondition record was made. No 2-hop alternative to dateTime is available in the provided paths.

Path 8 (hasDataProviderInstitute) is the direct mapping from ProblemCondition to DataProviderInstitute, which is semantically correct. No 2-hop path with finer granularity (e.g., code as part of the Institute resource) is available."

Since no further direct path for the name is provided, it should be attached as a label or property of the DataProviderInstitute instance created from org_code."
