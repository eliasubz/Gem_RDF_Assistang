This column is best used as an internal mapping key or to construct unique URIs for DrugPrescription individuals.
patient_id,gpt_nano,[0],0,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/hasPatient,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/hasPatient,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Patient,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Patient,,,,,,,,,1,1,"Path 1 connects DrugPrescription to Patient via AIDAVA:hasPatient, which is the most direct and semantically correct link for a patient identifier. Other paths (e.g., hasSubjectPseudoIdentifier) are designed for privacy-preserving IDs, not direct patient references."
medication_atc_code,gpt_nano,[4],4,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasCode,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasCode,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Code,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Code,,,,,,,,,1,1,"Path 5 (hasCode → Code) is the most appropriate as ATC codes are medical coding systems and the property is designed to link to such codes. Although path 6 (hasCode → Terminology) exists, Code is the more precise class for representing actual code values."
diagnosis_code,gpt_nano,[11],11,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasIndicationToStart,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasIndicationToStart,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Diagnosis,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Diagnosis,,,,,,,,,1,1,"Path 12 links DrugPrescription to Diagnosis via hasIndicationToStart, which is intended for the clinical justification for prescribing the drug (such as a diagnosis code). Path 13 (hasIndicationToStart → Intent) is not as suitable for diagnosis coding."
creation_date,gpt_nano,[17],17,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasDateTime,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasDateTime,http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime,http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime,,,,,,,,,1,1,"Path 18 (hasDateTime) is the only path that directly associates a date/time value with the DrugPrescription. The other date-related paths (19, 20) refer specifically to administration times, which are not the same as creation date."
times_a_day,gpt_nano,[10],10,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasFrequency,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasFrequency,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Quantity,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Quantity,,,,,,,,,1,1,"Path 11 (hasFrequency → Quantity) is appropriate because 'times_a_day' represents the frequency of administration, which is modeled as a Quantity. No other path represents dosing frequency."
dosage,gpt_nano,[9],9,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasDrugQuantity,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasDrugQuantity,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Quantity,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Quantity,,,,,,,,,1,1,"Path 10 (hasDrugQuantity → Quantity) is the most relevant because 'dosage' expresses the amount/form of drug per administration. Path 15 (hasQuantity → Quantity) might refer to overall quantity, but hasDrugQuantity is more specific to the context."
