row_id,gpt_nano,[-1],-1,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasQualitativeResult,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasQualitativeResult,http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string,http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string,,,,,,,,,1,1,'row_id' is a CSV internal identifier for the row and does not semantically correspond to any ontology property or path. It serves as a local key rather than data about the measurement entity itself.
patient_id,gpt_nano,"[16, 0]",0,0,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasSubjectPseudoIdentifier,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/hasPatient,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#SubjectPseudoIdentifier,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Patient,,,,,,,,,1,1,"The 'patient_id' corresponds to identifying the patient related to the measurement. Path 1 links Measurement to Patient via hasPatient, which is the most semantically appropriate and direct mapping."
measurement_code,gpt_nano,[3],3,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasCode,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasCode,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Code,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Code,,,,,,,,,1,1,"The 'measurement_code' represents a code that identifies the measurement type or concept. Path 4 leads to Code from Measurement via hasCode, which matches the semantic meaning. Path 5 targets Terminology, which is broader and less precise for a code value. Two-hop paths from Code do not provide better specificity for this column."
measurement_value,gpt_nano,[13],13,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasQuantity,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasQuantity,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Quantity,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Quantity,,,,,,,,,1,1,"The 'measurement_value' is a numeric value representing the quantity measured. Path 14 leads to Quantity, which is the appropriate ontological class for numeric measurement values. No longer paths from Quantity provide better semantic specificity relevant to this column."
measurement_unit,gpt_nano,[13],13,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasQuantity,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasQuantity,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Quantity,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Quantity,,,,,,,,,1,1,"Units are semantically part of the Quantity entity, so 'measurement_unit' should be associated with the Quantity linked via hasQuantity. No better two-hop path specifies unit separately, so unit is modeled as a property or attribute of Quantity."
measurement_date,gpt_nano,[19],19,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasMeasurementDateTime,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasMeasurementDateTime,http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime,http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime,,,,,,,,,1,1,"The 'measurement_date' clearly corresponds to the date/time when the measurement was taken. Path 20 (hasMeasurementDateTime) directly corresponds to this temporal information. Although path 18 (hasDateTime) also exists, hasMeasurementDateTime is semantically more precise for measurement events."
