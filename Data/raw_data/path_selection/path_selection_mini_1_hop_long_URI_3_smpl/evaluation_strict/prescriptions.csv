Although the Patient entity also has identifiers, 'row_id' is at DrugPrescription level, making path 16 optimal."
patient_id,gpt_nano,"[15, 0]",0,0,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasSubjectPseudoIdentifier,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/hasPatient,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#SubjectPseudoIdentifier,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Patient,,,,,,,,,1,1,"The 'patient_id' corresponds to the patient related to the drug prescription, best represented by the path from DrugPrescription to Patient via hasPatient. No deeper path provides better semantic resolution for a patient identifier."

The path through hasDrug to hasCode (Code) is semantically precise. Considering 2-hop alternatives, none surpass this direct semantic fit."

Mapping to hasIndicationToStart leading to Diagnosis is semantically accurate. Although Intent is an alternative, Diagnosis better captures coded diagnoses."

No deeper path offers better semantic specificity."

No suitable 2-hop extension improves semantic precision here."

This path semantically captures the dose including units. Other quantity paths (e.g., hasQuantity) are less specific."
