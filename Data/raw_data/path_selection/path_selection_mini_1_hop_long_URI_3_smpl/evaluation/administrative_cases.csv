Although path #6 also points to Terminology via hasCode, the code literal is primary, so path #5 is more direct and appropriate."

Path #17 (hasRecordDateTime) is most semantically appropriate to represent the record creation date/time associated with ProblemCondition.

No deeper paths for organization code exist, so 1-hop is optimal."

Although no explicit property for name is given, org_name logically belongs to the DataProviderInstitute entity reached by hasDataProviderInstitute."
