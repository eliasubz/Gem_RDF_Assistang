There is no direct ontology path for generic row identifiers. If used, it should be mapped to the subject URI or as an internal annotation outside the ontology's semantics."
patient_id,gpt_nano,"[12, 0]",0,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasSubjectPseudoIdentifier,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/hasPatient,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#SubjectPseudoIdentifier,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Patient,,,,,,,,,1,1,"The 'patient_id' refers to the patient associated with the problem condition. Path 1 (AIDAVA:hasPatient) directly links to a Patient entity. No 2-hop path starting from Patient is available in the provided options, so the direct path is optimal."
diagnosis_code,gpt_nano,[4],4,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasCode,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasCode,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Code,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#Code,,,,,,,,,1,1,"The 'diagnosis_code' is most accurately mapped to the medical code associated with the ProblemCondition. Path 5 (hasCode → Code) is preferred over path 6 (hasCode → Terminology), as the value is a code (numeric/string) rather than a terminology label. No 2-hop route from Code or Terminology is present among the paths, so the 1-hop to Code is optimal."

This is more precise than hasDateTime or hasOnsetDateTime (paths 14 or 16), which may refer to event or onset time rather than record creation."

No 2-hop alternatives from DataProviderInstitute are available, so the direct mapping is optimal."

While this is an attribute of DataProviderInstitute, the paths only allow direct linkage to the institute entity (via hasDataProviderInstitute). The actual name property would need to be set on the DataProviderInstitute instance, potentially using a standard label property (e.g., rdfs:label) outside the provided paths."
