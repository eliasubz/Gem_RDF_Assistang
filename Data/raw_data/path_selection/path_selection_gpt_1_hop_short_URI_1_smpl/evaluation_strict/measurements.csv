It should be used only as an internal key for mapping, not mapped to the ontology."

No further 2-hop paths are available from AIDAVA:Patient in the given list."

The 'hasCode' path to Code best fits this. No direct 2-hop path from Code is offered in the provided list."

Since only a 1-hop path to Quantity is available, this column's value should be mapped as part of the Quantity node along with 'measurement_value'. No 2-hop alternatives are provided."

No 2-hop paths from dateTime are possible. 'hasDateTime' (path 18) is also possible, but 'hasMeasurementDateTime' is more specific."
