However, row_id can serve as the local identifier for the DrugPrescription instance (i.e., the subject of the RDF statement), typically as the local part of the entity URI. No 2-hop path is available for this role."
patient_id,gpt_nano,[0],0,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/hasPatient,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/hasPatient,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Patient,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Patient,,,,,,,,,1,1,"patient_id represents the link between the prescription and the patient. Path 1 (hasPatient) is the direct link. There are no 2-hop paths from DrugPrescription to Patient or via hasPatient, so this is optimal."

Path 5 (hasCode) links DrugPrescription to Code. There's also path 6 (hasCode => Terminology), but unless the code system (e.g., ATC) is required, mapping directly to Code is most appropriate. No more specific 2-hop path for ATC code."

Path 12 (hasIndicationToStart => Diagnosis) is the most semantically accurate. There is an alternative (path 13) to Intent, but the code itself is a diagnosis, not an intent."
creation_date,gpt_nano,[17],17,1,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasDateTime,https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#hasDateTime,http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime,http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime,,,,,,,,,1,1,creation_date is the datetime when the prescription was created. Path 18 (hasDateTime) is the direct link for this timestamp. No 2-hop path offers a more specific mapping.

Path 11 (hasFrequency) links to Quantity, matching the semantics. No 2-hop path from hasFrequency leads to a more specific type."

Path 10 (hasDrugQuantity) is specifically for the quantity of drug prescribed. No 2-hop path from hasDrugQuantity; this is optimal.
