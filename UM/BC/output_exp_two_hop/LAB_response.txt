Let's analyze each CSV column systematically, selecting the most semantically appropriate path from the available options. I will provide detailed reasoning and note any necessary data transformations.

---

### Column 1: GEN_IDNUMBER
- **Value:** P0023919393932
- **Reasoning:** This appears to be a patient identifier; however, no direct 'identifier' property is provided. The closest is 'hasSubjectPseudoIdentifier' (Path 13), which suggests an identifier for the patient.
- **Selected Path:** **13** `AIDAVA/Patient`:`hasSubjectPseudoIdentifier`
- **Justification:** This property explicitly indicates a pseudo-identifier for a patient, matching the column's purpose.
- **Transformation:** No transformation needed; map string directly.

---

### Column 2: TABLE_IDENTIFIER
- **Value:** P0023919393932_L3316_v008
- **Reasoning:** Likely an internal or dataset-specific ID; perhaps associated with data files or identifiers. Since it’s a unique dataset identifier, it can be mapped to the 'hasDataFile' property, or as a pseudo-identifier for a data file.
- **Selected Path:** **8** `AIDAVA/Procedure`:`hasDataFile`
- **Justification:** The value resembles a data file or version identifier, fitting the `hasDataFile` property. Alternatively, if representing an identifier, could consider a dedicated property, but within provided options, `hasDataFile` aligns best.
- **Transformation:** No transformation; treat as string.

---

### Column 3: FIRST_NAME
- **Value:** Klaas
- **Reasoning:** Personal name; common in patient data. There is no explicit 'hasFirstName' property in the paths, but typically, the patient's name can be stored as a 'foaf:name' or similar. Given the ontology, perhaps the patient's name is stored via a custom property; but since not explicitly available, perhaps as 'hasSubjectPseudoIdentifier' is not appropriate.
- **Alternative options?** No explicit property for name in the provided paths. Possibly, the name can be stored as a 'hasFreeText' in a related procedure or as a custom data property.
- **Best fit:** Since no explicit property exists, the closest is to store it as a 'hasFreeText' in a related context, but it's not ideal.
- **Given constraints:** No suitable path; perhaps store it as a literal associated with the patient entity directly, outside provided paths.
- **Decision:** Map as a literal property attached directly to Patient entity (not in paths). Since this is outside scope, potentially skip or annotate as not mapped.
- **Note:** For completeness, indicate no mapping available.

---

### Column 4: LAST_NAME
- **Value:** Van Hooijdonk
- **Reasoning:** Same as first name; personal name. Same considerations apply.
- **Same conclusion:** No explicit property; store as literal attached to patient entity if possible.
- **Note:** Not covered precisely by provided paths.

---

### Column 5: GLUCOSE_GLUCOSE
- **Value:** 7.8 mmol/l
- **Reasoning:** Laboratory result; can be mapped as a 'hasFreeText' or possibly as a measurement linked via 'hasDataFile' or 'hasCode'.
- **Ideal Path:**
  - Since this is a measurement, perhaps linked via a Procedure and using 'hasDataFile' or 'hasCode'.
  - Alternatively, store as a property of the patient or as a measurement linked to a procedure.
- **Selected Path:** **18** `AIDAVA/Procedure`:`hasStartDateTime` (not ideal), but better to use 'hasFreeText' for raw result.
- **Best fit:** Use 'hasFreeText' (Path 17) to store the result as a string.
- **Justification:** The value is a measurement result, best stored as free text associated with a procedure.
- **Transformation:** No transformation; store as string.

---

### Column 6: HEMOLYTISCH_HEMOLYTISCH
- **Value:** Licht
- **Reasoning:** Qualitative measurement or observation; likely a status or note.
- **Selected Path:** **17** `hasFreeText`
- **Justification:** Same as previous, store as free text describing the observation.
- **Transformation:** No transformation needed.

---

### Column 7: HEMOGLOBINE_HEMOGLOBINE
- **Value:** 7.2 mmol/l
- **Reasoning:** Laboratory measurement; numerical value with units.
- **Selected Path:** **17** `hasFreeText`
- **Justification:** For simplicity, store as free text; ideally, would be modeled as a measurement with proper units.
- **Transformation:** No transformation beyond string.

---

### Column 8: HEMATOCRIET_L
- **Value:** 0.35 l/l
- **Reasoning:** Similar to above; a lab result.
- **Selected Path:** **17** `hasFreeText`
- **Justification:** Store as free text.
- **Transformation:** No transformation.

---

### Column 9: KALIUM_L
- **Value:** 4.2 mmol/l
- **Same reasoning as above:**
- **Selected Path:** **17**

---

### Column 10: EGFR_M2
- **Value:** >90 ml/min/1.73m2
- **Reasoning:** A calculated kidney function metric.
- **Selected Path:** **17** `hasFreeText`
- **Justification:** Store as descriptive text.
- **Transformation:** No transformation.

---

### Column 11: ERY'S_UL
- **Value:** 3 /ul
- **Reasoning:** Lab count; could be stored as measurement or free text.
- **Selected Path:** **17**

---

### Column 12: LEUCOCYTEN_UL
- **Value:** 5.1 x 10*9/1
- **Reasoning:** Quantitative measurement.
- **Selected Path:** **17**

---

### Column 13: KREATININE_L
- **Value:** 43 umol/l
- **Reasoning:** Lab result.
- **Selected Path:** **17**

---

### Column 14: LDH_L
- **Value:** 318 U/l
- **Reasoning:** Lab measurement.
- **Selected Path:** **17**

---

### Column 15: CALCIUM_L
- **Value:** 2.31 mmol/l
- **Reasoning:** Lab result.
- **Selected Path:** **17**

---

- **Selected Path:** **17**

---

### Column 17: LYMFOCYTEN_LYMFOCYTEN

---

### Column 18: ERYTROCYTEN_I
- **Value:** 3.85 x10^12/I
- **Reasoning:** Quantitative measurement.
- **Selected Path:** **17**

---

### Column 19: FOSFAAT_L

- **Reasoning:** Lab result.
- **Selected Path:** **17**

---

### Column 20: GGT_L
- **Value:** 141 U/l
- **Reasoning:** Enzyme activity measurement.
- **Selected Path:** **17**

## Final notes:
- For patient names, no explicit mapping was available; ideally, custom properties should be added.
- Numeric lab data is stored as free text for simplicity; a more precise modeling would involve creating measurement entities with units.
- All data transformations are minimal; just ensure data is stored as literals.

If you'd like, I can generate RDF triples or Turtle syntax for specific data points.
