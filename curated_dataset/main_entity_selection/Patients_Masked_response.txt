Let's analyze the CSV columns and RDF entities for **semantic mapping** and identify the overarching entity plus candidates.

| 1054          | Emergency                              | Encounter class/type                    |
| 5828          | A. Boarsma                             | Practitioner or provider name            |
| 1856          | 2023-08-01T23:00:12.0000               | Datetime (admission, event, etc)         |
| 0583          | 2023-08-18T14:00:00.0000               | Datetime (discharge, event, etc)         |
| 6832          | MI                                     | Condition, region, or measurement        |
| 8563          | Roen                                   | Possibly family name                    |
| 9537          | Thijk                                  | Possibly given name                     |

## 1. Overarching Entity

Looking at the column contents, the **common entity** tying these together is likely the "Patient" (i.e., every row contains information about a patient and related events/attributes).

From the RDF entity list, the **best match** is:

**Overarching Entity:**  
**[`https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Patient`](https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Patient)**

All the columns -- patient id, identifiers, dates, names, conditions, provider, and administrative details -- can be modeled as properties or linked records connected to a patient instance.

### Justification:
- Identifiers (`patient_id`, etc.) → properties of Patient.
- Demographic/date columns → properties of Patient.
- Names and healthcare events/procedures → related to Patient.
- Possible conditions/codes → diagnosis/observation for Patient.
- Provider/Practitioner may better attach to an encounter, but in absence of encounter-level context, still anchored to Patient.

### Comments

- If events (admission/discharge) are part of an **Encounter**, then "Encounter" would be the better anchor, but none is exposed in the RDF list; still, the patient entity is a safe and central unifier.
- Encounter-specific data (e.g., `Emergency`, encounter class) might also map more precisely, but without explicit encounter/RDF info, falling back on Patient is standard.

If you clarify any columns/values (e.g., what MI, Roen, Thijk refer to), I can update/refine the mapping and candidates!
