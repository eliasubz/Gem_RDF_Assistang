Let's approach your questions step by step.

**1. Overarching Entity for All Columns**

Examining the CSV columns:

- patient_id (ID for the patient)
- id (can be admission/encounter or patient)
- birthdate
- gender_code_snomed
- department (hospital department)
- doctor
- admission_date
- discharge_date
- admission_reason
- given_name
- family_name

This is mostly about a **hospital admission/encounter of a patient**, with attributes of the patient (identifiers, birthdate, gender, name) and of the hospital visit (admission date, discharge, doctor, department).

From your ontology entities, the **overarching entity** that all of these columns could be linked to is:

> **https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/sphn#HealthcareEncounter**  
> This reflects the hospitalization event, which can have properties linking to Patient, Admission/Discharge, Reason, Department, Doctor, etc.

**Alternative:**  
If you want to focus on the patient as the subject (rare for event-centric structures),  
> **https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Patient**

But, usually, the encounter (visit/admission) is the entity to which all others are attached.
