Let's break this into your two questions:

## 1. Overarching entity for all CSV columns

Given your columns and sample values:

| Column      | Example Value                  |
|-------------|-------------------------------|
| patient_id  | 129342KW                       |
| id          | L3335                          |
| 3945        | 1963-08-13T00:00:00.0000       |
| 2956        | 248153007                      |
| 1054        | Emergency                      |
| 5828        | A. Boarsma                     |
| 1856        | 2023-08-01T23:00:12.0000       |
| 0583        | 2023-08-18T14:00:00.0000       |
| 6832        | MI                             |
| 8563        | Roen                           |
| 9537        | Thijk                          |

The columns reference an encounter or patient data–such as identifiers, dates, providers, possibly conditions, and names (patient/provider). In healthcare data models (such as HL7 FHIR or ontologies based on SPHN/AIDAVA), such records typically center around a **Patient** or an **Encounter**.

### Based on these columns and your ontology list:
- Columns like patient_id and various dates are always linked to a **Patient**, and possibly to an encounter (visit, admission).
- However, “id” and some values like “Emergency” suggest more context related to **encounters/visits**.

**Conclusion:**  
**The best high-level encompassing entity is most likely [`https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Patient`](https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Patient).**  
All columns could ultimately be related to a patient, even if some reference “encounters,” those are always under the patient's umbrella.

Alternatively, if your intent is to integrate *encounters*, and each row is a unique encounter, you could consider an *Encounter* entity. But from your given options, there is no explicit "Encounter" class; the closest is **Patient**.

## 2. 15 Candidate Entities (Array)

Given your data and the RDF entity list, here are 15 candidate entities relevant to mapping your columns:

```json
[
  "https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Patient",
  "https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/PatientIdentifier",
  "https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/hasPatientIdentifier",
  "https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/hasBirthDateTime",
  "https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/hasFullName",
  "https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/SubjectName",
  "https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/hasSubjectName",
  "https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/DiagnosticReport",
  "https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/hasCategory",
  "http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/encounter-class",
  "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime",
  "https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Condition",
  "https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Observation",
  "https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/hasMeasurement",
  "https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Procedure"
]
```

### Reasoning:
- Chose entities for patient (core), identifiers, names, birthdate, and entity for recording observations/procedures.
- Included data types (e.g., dateTime) due to date columns.
- Encounter-class and category to cover events like "Emergency."
- DiagnosticReport and Condition for potential medical categorical data.
- SubjectName to help with proper names.

**Summary:**
1. Overarching entity:  
   - **https://biomedit.ch/rdf/sphn-ontology/AIDAVA/Patient**
2. 15 candidate mapping entities:
   - See array above.

If you want to lean toward *encounter* or *visit* records as the core, let me know—can supply that mapping with your entity list if you wish.
